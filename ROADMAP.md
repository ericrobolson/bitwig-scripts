# UX Ideas

- Play with single hand navigation. E.g. if you want to record over something, you tap record, then tap the clip you want to record.
- Play with holding buttons down to do actions. If you want to do other actions that may require multiple things at once, like stopping multiple tracks, make it so you hold the button down and then select all tracks
